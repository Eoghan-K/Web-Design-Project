					<h3 class="center heading">Renewable Energy</h3>
					<img src="../images/renewable.jpg" id="pic1">
					<p>renewable energy provides one of the
					leading solutions to the climate change issue. By providing
					‘carbon-neutral’ sources of power, heat, cooling and
					transport fuels, renewable energy options such as wind,
					solar, biomass, hydro, wave and tidal offer a safe transition
					to a low carbon economy.
					<br><br>
					The concept of a transition to a carbon-free economy has
					become broadly understood and been outlined by many
					actors from G81
					, the United Nations, the International
					Energy Agency, Governments and industry alike. In the
					long run, renewables are the only energy source that
					provide a sustainable carbon neutral energy supply</p>

					<h3 class="center heading">Carbon Capture</h3>
					<img src="../images/carbon.jpg" id="pic2">
					<p>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture up to 90% 
					of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions pro­duced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation 
					and industrial processes, preventing the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
					<br><br>
					Furthermore, the use of CCS with renewable biomass is one of the few carbon abatement technolo­gies that 
					can be used in a 'carbon-negative' mode ­– actually taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.</p>

					<h3 class="center heading">Nuclear Fusion</h3>
					<img src="../images/fusion.jpg" id="pic3">
					<p>Unlike the nuclear fission in modern day reactors, fusion is much safer. Since no radioactive waste 
					is produced, the dangers of a meltdown are non-existent. There is also no danger of fusion going into a runaway reaction.
					<br><br>
					Since nuclear fusion is such a powerful way to generate energy,it could eventually replace all other forms of energy 
					production anywhere in the world. That would mean that generating energy from fossil fuels would no longer be necessary.
					In fact, just one kilogram of fusion fuel can provide the same amount of energy as 10 million kilograms of fossil fuel. 
					So the planet's electricity production could be entirely carbon neutral.</p>
